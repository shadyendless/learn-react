# Part 1 - Getting Started
## Overview
Before we can make anything crazy, we need to get React running. This part focuses on getting React up and running as well as configuring the build system to use SASS instead of CSS.

## Goals
By the end of this section you will have done the following:
* Stood up a React development environment with `create-react-app`
* Created a basic landing page.
* Styled the basic landing page with SASS.

## Tasks
1. Get the default React app up and running with `create-react-app`. (You can read more [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)).
2. Edit the default React app to introduce yourself. Add headers and paragraphs giving a little bit of insight into who you are.
3. Change the `App.css` to `App.scss`. Your application should no-longer be styled.
4. Configure your application so that it knows how to process SASS files. You can find information on how to do that [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-preprocessor-sass-less-etc).
5. Style the page and work with it as if it was regular HTML. Treat it as a landing page advertising **you**. For now it might seem like there's no reason to use React, but the next challenges will make it do more.
