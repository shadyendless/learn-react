# Learning React
This is a set of small tasks designed to help you learn React. You'll be starting with small components that don't seem to do much and start to compose them to build larger applications.

By working through each of the individual parts listed below, you'll build up your knowledge of React so that you can make anything you can imagine.

## Want Your Work Reviewed?
If you want me to look over your solutions to these challenges, then please open an issue with a link to your repository where you are working through the challenges. Bonus points if you tag your issue with which part you completed and even more bonus points if you create a separate branch of your project for each part of the challenge.

I look forward to seeing what you create!

## NOTE
This is simply a list of challenges for you to undertake to learn React, it is not designed to be a tutorial or guide to get there.
